-- Hello - this is a very short document as a reference to you ( and myself ) 
-- The basic commands of SQL and what they can achieve are highlighted here

-- The table I will be using can be accessed by using the following link:
-- https://www.programiz.com/sql/online-compiler/


-- Imagine we have a table called 'Customers'
-- With the columns 'customer_id', 'first_name', 'last_name' & 'age'

-- Imagine we have another table called 'Orders'
-- With the columns 'order_id', 'item', 'amount', 'customer_id'


-- \\__________________SELECTION__________________// --

--  ⬇⬇ Will select the 'first_name' column from the table 'Customers'
select first_name from Customers;

-- We can take this a step further by making this command into...
-- This will only select the 'first_name' fields which start with 'J'
select first_name from Customers where first_name like 'J%';

-- Keep in mind, this is CAP sensitive!
-- Conversely - you can find items that end with 'X' by doing '%X' 

-- ⬇⬇ We can also select every field from a column by the following...
select * from Customers; 

-- ⬇⬇ If you're curious as to how many items are in a column, you can do :
select count(*) from Customers;


-- \\__________________INSERTION__________________// --

--  ⬇⬇ Will insert (add) into first_name the name 'name1'
insert into Customers (first_name) values ('name1');
-- but there is a problem with this, as only the name is added 
-- This leaves a the other 3 columns blank!

-- [[ BTW, you can also add multiple names to the same position ]]
-- This can be done by running the following...
insert into Customers (first_name) values ('name1, name2');

-- \\_____________DELETING & UPDATING_____________// --

-- If you made a mistake you can, of course, delete it 
delete from Customers where first_name == 'name1';

-- Likewise, you can also update any field that might need to be changed
update Customers set customer_id = '7' where (first_name == 'name1');
